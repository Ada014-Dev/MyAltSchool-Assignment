        <p>Name: Uche Blessing</p>
        <p>AltSchool ID: ALT/SOE/024/4853</p>
        <p>Biography:</p>
        <p>My name is Uche Blessing, I am from the South Eastern part of Nigeria. I love the unusual things, like i believe if it is not hard i am not serious. 
            Having cerifications from Moshood Abiola Polytechnic, I went further to acquire a degree at the prestigious Imo State University.
            I look forward to transition into tech because of the interesting technologies. I remember growing up, i love to open up our radio, tourch, phones, anything, just to
            be sure or see what was inside it that makes it work. 
            I love food
            I love to see people smile, and even making even making them smile makes me more happy, even when i hardly smile when i am all by myself.
            I love food. Food is art if you ask me!
            I currently sincerely apologize for a living.</p>

        <h1>Why I joined AltSchool Africa</h1>
        <p>My main goal of joining this world class institution of learning is because, Altschool has a proven track record of building its students who has little or no knowledge in a choosen field and has been able to groom them into a world class product.
            I believe in AltSchool africa, my long term dream of becoming a software engineer will become reality.
            And of course to make bastard money and empower other young folks. </p>
